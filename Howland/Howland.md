The signal injection system is implemented with a Howland current source which is a type of voltage-controlled current source. The human body's cross-sectional resistance can vary from 200 to 2000 ohms while breathing. Therefore the howland is designed to deliver a constant current over the 200 to 2000 ohms resistive load. This design implements a bipolar injection system so it must be set up to receive and send two signals 180 degrees out of phase. This model follows the improved Howland design implemented by Dr. Mellenthin. Which will require precision resistors to at least 1% accuracy to obtain the precision needed for this medical imagining device.
